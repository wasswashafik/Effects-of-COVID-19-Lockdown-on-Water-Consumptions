Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Water Consumptions: a Northern Italy Case Study

The folder attached in the repository includes the content briefly described in the following:
1. Water consumptions data are included in two .csv file separated for 2019 and 2020, named "dataset2019" ans "dataset2020". For both files the first row cointains the date-time references, while the first columns contains the serial numbers.
2. The script "DataAnalysis2019.m" analyses the water consumptions of 2019 and the script "DataAnalysis2020.m" analyses the water consumptions of 2020. In the script "Comparison19_20.m" all the evaluation and comparison are made.
3. The other .txt and .xlsx file are used in the scripts for the division of the days of the week, for the division of weekdays from saturdays and sundays, and for evaluating separately commercial and residential users, removing users with no consumption or empty data.

Note. The codes have been developed and tested by using MATLABÂ® version R2019b.
